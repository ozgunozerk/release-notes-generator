AI generated tool, took me 20 minutes to write this project...

This is made for my custom needs, in case anyone else is interested, I'm making it open-source.
I'm not planning to make it generic, this is not a new open-source project. I'm just sharing what I'm using.
Fork the code or clone it, the code is pretty simple.
