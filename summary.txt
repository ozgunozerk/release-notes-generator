PR title: Summary bug
PR summary: Previously,`update()` method for `Summary`:
1. acquire lock for parsing the summary
2. release that lock
3. acquire a new lock for writing to summary
4. write, then release the lock

Also, it was moving the cursor (seeking) to the beginning of the file, and then flushes. 

I have fixed those 2 things in this PR. 

Also, yanking the version, since I'll publish a new version (we have key generation on CLI right now, and this small bug fix)

Closes #202 

Note: will squash commit


PR title: key generation if user does not have a public key beforehand
PR summary: This PR adds a new feature, which is having the ability to generate public key and mnemonic in the CLI.
Closes #199 

New flow for the farmer address during `init` step:

1. CLI asks the the user if they have an existing public key
2. if not, a new prompt for if user wants to generate a public key
3. display the mnemonic, show the proper messages, then redact it, and prompt user to prove if they stored the mnemonic (ask random words from the 12 word mnemonic)
4. if users passes the test, display the public key, and set it

Redacting the mnemonic was important for this setup, and I'm using crossterm to handle edge cases here. Code should be safe for all sized terminals for redacting the mnemonic completely without clearing other parts of the terminal.


There are two [versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels):

- x86-64-v2: for older processors since ~2009 and some old VMs
